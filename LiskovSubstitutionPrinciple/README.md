## What does Liskov Substitution Principle say?
We should be able to substitute base class objects with child class objects wherever base class object is expected and this should not alter behaviour/characteristics of program.

## Example of Liskov Substitution Principle
Here base class object is providing a specific behaviour and this base class object is now substituted with child class object, that behaviour should not alter.

What is expected to happen in that particular code should happen even if we change the base class object with the child class object.
